Blood pressure readings are a crucial indicator of cardiovascular health, providing valuable insights into the force of blood against the walls of your arteries. Understanding these readings is essential for managing your health and reducing your risk of heart disease and other complications. Here's a breakdown of what the numbers mean:

- Systolic Pressure (Top Number): The systolic pressure represents the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats and pumps blood out during a heartbeat. It's the higher number in a blood pressure reading and is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). A normal systolic pressure is typically considered to be less than 120 mmHg. Elevated systolic pressure, between 120 and 129 mmHg, may indicate prehypertension, while readings of 130 mmHg or higher are classified as high blood pressure (hypertension).

- Diastolic Pressure (Bottom Number): The diastolic pressure measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart is at rest between beats. It's the lower number in a blood pressure reading and is also measured in mmHg. A normal diastolic pressure is usually less than 80 mmHg. Diastolic readings between 80 and 89 mmHg are considered elevated, while readings of 90 mmHg or higher indicate hypertension.

- Interpreting Blood Pressure Readings: Blood pressure readings are typically expressed as systolic over diastolic pressure (e.g., 120/80 mmHg). Optimal blood pressure is generally considered to be less than 120/80 mmHg. Higher readings may indicate hypertension, which can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and other cardiovascular problems. It's important to monitor your blood pressure regularly, especially if you have risk factors for heart disease, such as obesity, diabetes, or a family history of hypertension. If you have elevated or high blood pressure, lifestyle modifications and, in some cases, medication may be recommended to help lower your blood pressure and reduce your risk of complications.

Understanding your blood pressure readings empowers you to take control of your health and make informed decisions about lifestyle changes and medical interventions. By monitoring your blood pressure regularly and working with your healthcare provider, you can maintain healthy blood pressure levels and reduce your risk of heart disease and other associated conditions.
